title: 8. Groom the backlog
---
With many hypotheses to tackle now listed on your issue-tracking board, it’s time to prioritize again. Divide your content in three Trello columns:

1. One column for incoming feature ideas. This column could be called __story candidates__ (using agile terminology) or __all hypotheses__ (lean startup terminology). 
2. One column for features that we would like to see in an “ideal” future version of the product (think two or three releases ahead). This could be called the __product backlog__ or __hypotheses for entire product__. 
3. One column for hypotheses to test that would comprise the first release, the minimum viable product (MVP). This could be called __release backlog__ or __hypotheses for MVP__. This should consist of the most essential hypotheses that, if pursued, would deliver value to the primary set of users.

>Your turn: The product owner and project lead should order stories in the candidates column from most important to least important. Then, they need to decide which stories should be moved to the product backlog, and finally which make it into the release backlog.
